# Summary

As I come to the end of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree, I put all my skills to use by reworking through the Titanic dataset.
This involved:
- cleaning the data, handling any missing values
- visualizing the data
- engineering new features
- applying ML algorithms to predict which passengers would survive
