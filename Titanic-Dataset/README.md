# Summary

As I come to the end of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree, I put all my skills to use by reworking through the Titanic dataset.
As part of this, I:
- cleaned the data, handling any missing values
- visualized the data
- engineered new features
- applied ML algorithms to predict which passengers would survive
